    <p> I was born in Silverton, Oregon and raised for the most part in Woodburn, OR. 
        I've moved around a few times living in Canby, Wilsonville, Beaverton, Portland, and short stint in Oakland, Ca.
        When I had free time I enojoyed going on hikes, traveling to visit family, and checking out new restaurants. 
        Now I will be spending most of my time in front of a computer screen, fun!

    <p> My name is Danny Hogan and I am 22 years old. I was born here in Portland, but moved to Florida shortly after 
        turning 7 years old. I definitely consider the Pacific North West my home, but don't mind the occasional visit back down south for some sunshine. I love video games, working out, good food, and spending time with friends and family!

    <p> Hi, I’m Susan and I’m from Eugene, Oregon. I like to eat pizza and grilled cheese. 
        I really like fruit, and going outside for a hike. I also like to play clarinet and make music. 
        I recently visited Eugene because my parents live there. We went for a hike on Spencer’s Butte, but 
        there was too much mist outside to see anything. Still, we breathed in a lot of fresh air and got some exercise, which made it more than worth it. 
        I look forward to hiking in Eugene in the future, as well as spending quality time with family and friends. 
        My dad is really into watching/following Oregon Ducks football, basketball, and softball

    <p> I wish I could make this up. I grew up in Redmond, WA, just outside of Seattle. 
        I really like being outside, kayaking, and my pets. I have 2 dogs and 2 cats, my girlfriend and 
        I like to call it "the farm."  Our dogs are named Rory and Smokey Joe. Our cats are named Tybalt and 
        Ranger.  That's all about me!
